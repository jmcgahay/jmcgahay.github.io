I'm a 3rd year PhD student in Linguistics at the University of California, Los Angeles. 

The main focus of my research involves using computer simulations of sound change informed by rational speech perception models to shed light on phonological typology. My primary advisor is [Megha Sundara](https://linguistics.ucla.edu/person/megha-sundara/), with additional advisement from [Bruce Hayes](https://brucehayes.org/) and [Meg Cychosz](https://megseekosh.github.io/).
